# Clothes For The Weather

Clothes for the Weather is a project that provides a weather description of the place you plan to visit, and suggests you the appropriate clothing accordingly. 

It uses OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data of a given location. In order to have the API access, it is necessary to make an account on openweathermap.org. Once the API Key is obtained, paste it in the script **weather.py** and then run.

It also generates a report, which stores all your search results, along with the timestamp.
